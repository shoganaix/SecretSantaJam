## Project Objective
This video game is a **roguelike adventure** where the player controls a pigeon.
The game is structured similarly to _"Incryption"_, with a map featuring different paths that include battles, minibosses, and chests.
The ultimate goal is to navigate through various intersections and ultimately face a boss at the end of the chosen path.

The gameplay is grid-based, where players engage in strategic battles using a deck of cards. 
Each card in the deck represents a different action, such as movement, healing, shielding, and damage. 
Players will need to carefully select their path, manage their resources, and plan their moves to overcome increasingly difficult challenges.

## Features

 ### Cards & Deck
#### The game features a deck of **15 cards** in total. There are **4** types of cards, each with a unique purpose:
- **Movement:**
  
These cards let you move in 4 directions (up, down, left, right) on the board.
- **Attack:**
  
Perform attacks on a row or a column.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only attack if you’re positioned in the front row
- **Healing:**
  
These cards restore some of your health.
> [!NOTE]
> You can only heal if you’re in the back row.
- **Protection:**
  
Use these cards to shield yourself from enemy attacks.
  
  ### Gameplay
Both you and the enemy share a simultaneous timer. 
Each turn lasts 2 seconds, during which you must plan your strategy and play as many cards as you want.

You can play multiple cards per turn, but be careful! If you run out of cards in your deck, you’ll lose.
